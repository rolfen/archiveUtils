MISC NOTES:

# This is a nice way to extract exif as xml:

exiftool -a -X -n ./2023/06/15/DSC00259.ARW

# Delete in camera JPG (we assume that it's an in-camera jpeg if it's next to a RAW with the same base name)

 find . -iname "*.ARW" -exec sh -c 'rm -f `dirname {}``basename {} .ARW`.JPG' \;

TODO:

 - Test test how scripts handles Ctrl-C or being killed, specifically test for writing incompleted files
 - Test consistency of checksums across platforms
 - previews-rawdigest on linux dumps garbage into the shell
