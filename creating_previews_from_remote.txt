# or just use the script remote-previews

# step 1
# copy originals from b2 remote to local directory
# Example:
rclone copy b2ro:Droppit/ArchivePhoto/2021/04 /home/rolf/photo/archive/2021/04 --progress --immutable

# step 2
# use previews.bash to extract previews from originals to another directory
# run it again to make sure that all previews were extracted
# also may want to run previews-rawdigest and previews-vid in the same way

# step 3
# replace originals with empty placeholders
find . -name "*.ARW" -type f -exec bash -c 'echo  > "${0}"' {} \;
find . -name "*.ORF" -type f -exec bash -c 'echo  > "${0}"' {} \;
# also do it for MTS or any other format that you handled

# goto step 1, repeat until all files are copied, that is rclone in step 1 returns after completing checks with 0 transfers.
