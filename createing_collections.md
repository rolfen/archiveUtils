On windows, we use [LinkShellExtension](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#contact) to easily create hardlinks.

So we have a "preview" folder and we pick our collections from the folder and subfolders, creating hardlinks in collection folders without worrying about data duplication.
